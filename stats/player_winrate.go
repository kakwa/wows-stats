### Description

The blue curve in the graph represents the distribution of players based on their win rate, considering only players who have reached a minimum number of battles.

Each point (x, y) on the graph represents the following:

- **x**: The win rate range of the players.
- **y**: The number of players whose win rate falls between x and x + "step".

The green curve represents the [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), which is obtained using the population's average win rate and its standard deviation.

The graph's subtitle displays the following information:

* Mean: The average win rate of the player population.
* Standard Deviation: The measure of the spread or dispersion of win rates within the population.
* Population Size: The total number of players considered in the analysis.
* Step: The interval used for dividing win rates into ranges.

By visualizing this graph, you can observe the distribution of players' win rates and compare it to the expected Normal Distribution based on the population's average win rate and standard deviation.

### Code

[/stats/player_winrate.go](https://github.com/wows-tools/wows-stats/blob/main/stats/player_winrate.go)

### Methodology

Take all the intervals (wr-1, wr-2) of length "step" between 0% and 100%.

For each interval, count the number of players with a win rate between wr-1 and wr-2.

From this, compute the Normal Distribution and we display the 2 curves.

### Caveats

#### Spikiness

Due to a large number of players having a low battle count, the distribution of Win Rates is not evenly spread.

For instance, if many players have only 4 battles, the graph will show spikes at 0% (0/4), 25% (1/4), 50% (2/4), 75% (3/4), and 100% (4/4) win rates.

As a result, when considering low minimum battle thresholds, the charts may appear "spiky" around these win rate values.

To partially compensate for this effect, wider steps are used in the charts with lower battle thresholds. This helps to smooth out the spikes and provide a clearer representation of the distribution.

With higher minimum battle thresholds, this issue disappears.

#### Other

Keep in mind it's a simple player distribution.

As it's more likely to encounter a frequent player with 2000, 5000 or +10000 battles, specially at high tiers, this chart doesn't reflect what your MM looks like.

This is especially true for the chart using the lowest threshold (1 battle) as it contains all the players trying the game for a few battles and leaving after that (not to mention protected MM bellow 200 battles).
